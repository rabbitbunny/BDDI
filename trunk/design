Design document

A compute cluster customized for unit testing.

We need a job creator, a database, a scheduler, a processor, all in a modular system including remote VM booting and quick repo dispersion to the running VMs and a fat database of completed tests.

job creator--

automated, triggered, AI directed, or user defined job creation and queueing system entry

database--

hopefully something distributed, 

scheduler--

uses a distributed queing system to send jobs to local processors

processor--

uses data from the database to run tests as defined by the job creator
